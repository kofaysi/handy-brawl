Functions to manipulate the virtual deck of cards according to the Handy Brawl game rules.

The deck is represented as a list with lists (cards) from top (start=0) to bottom (end=len(deck)-1). 

Functions:

- rotate_card_to_face(c : list, f : str) -> list:
- flip(c : list) -> list:
- rotate(c : list) -> list:
- rotate_flip(c : list) -> list:
- back_shift(tup : tuple, n=1 : int) -> tuple:
- check_cards_unique(d : list) -> bool:
- unzip_hash(d_hash : str) -> list, list:
- deck_changed(d1 : list, d2 : list, i=1 : int) -> bool:
- adjust_deck(d : list, a : str, p : str) -> list:
- move_deck(d : list, a : str, r : str) -> list:
- move_card(d : list, i : int, j : int) -> list:
- rotate_top_card(d : list, i=0 : int) -> list:
- hit_deck(d : list, n : int) -> list:

Variables:

- game_turns : dict
    Dictionary to store the hashes of the game turns, game_turns[result] = origin.
    There can be multiple origins, but only one result is counted, when executing or comparing multiple games.
    The deck hash with no existing key with the same name, is the starting/first deck.
- card_status_symbols : dict
    Dictionary of status names and symbols for displaying in terminal.
- card_colours : dict
    Dictionary of card names and colours for displaying in terminal.
